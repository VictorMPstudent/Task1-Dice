Please download the repository, it works better.

Vercel is not showing idex directly because is inside a folder or idk why. It doesn't open de Dice game either. This is very frustrating,
as with de downloaded version all works perfect.
I toggled a setting on vercel to navigate in the folders when you open the page.
Please go directly to pages, then it takes the index one immedietly and you can see it all good, exept entering the Dice game.
